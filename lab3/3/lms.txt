Adaptive Noise Cancellation using the Least
Mean Square Algorithm

The LMS adaptive filter uses the reference signal (on
the "In" port) and the error signal (on the "Err" port) to automatically
 match the filter response in the block labeled "Noise filter".
 As it converges to the correct filter, the filtered noise should
 be completely subtracted from the "Signal + Noise" signal and 
the "Error Signal" should contain only the original signal.
